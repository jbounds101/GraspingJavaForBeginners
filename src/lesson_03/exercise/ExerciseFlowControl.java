           In this program, you are given two arguments, which will determine the behavior of your program
           The first argument is "isStudent", and the other is their "grade", they are of type boolean and int, and
           do not need to be redeclared, just simply use the variables in your code.

           If isStudent is true, print their letter grade with the following criteria:
           grade = 97-100 -> A+
           93-96 -> "A"
           90-92 -> "A-"
           87-89 -> "B+"
           83-86 -> "B"
           80-82 -> "B-"
           <80 -> "very bad grade :("


           Message printed should say: "You got a(n) #" where # is the calculated letter grade or message.
           Use "an" for A-, A, A+ grades and "a" for everything else.

           You can assume there will be no grades given above 100

           If isStudent is false, print "Not a student!".

           Note: Make sure to use System.out.println and NOT System.out.print

        if (isStudent) {
            // Do something?
        }



    }
}
